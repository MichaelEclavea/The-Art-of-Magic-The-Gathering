        <h2 class="bio-name">Taylor</h2>
       
        <p>I am a problem solver with a knack for technology. Before I
          entered the world of Software Development I was a Manufacturing
          Engineer. I loved setting up new machines and learning their
          software. Designing tools to produce the perfect part while still
          meeting the constraints of the machine was very satisfying. I
          realized my favorite part of the job was learning new problem
          solving technologies. When it became clear I was ready for a
          career change, software development stood out as the ultimate
          problem solving technology. I started teaching myself web
          development and was immediately hooked. I found my way into a boot
          camp and which pushed my capacity for learning even farther. The
          more I learn the more it solidifies that Software Development is
          exactly where I want to be.

        <p>Keith Musig is a software developer living in Tacoma, Washington. He has a background in visual arts and performs jazz guitar around the greater Seattle area. In the past week he has become a fan of the art of Magic the Gathering as It was mandatory in order to be in a group with Taylor, Michael, and Czarl. He went out and bought some cards and played for hours when finally discovering that he was playing ‘Uno’ he was playing. The artwork of Magic the Gathering is amazing and it’s been great to work with this team!
