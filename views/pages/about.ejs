        <p>I am a problem solver with a knack for technology. Before I
          entered the world of Software Development I was a Manufacturing
          Engineer. I loved setting up new machines and learning their
          software. Designing tools to produce the perfect part while still
          meeting the constraints of the machine was very satisfying. I
          realized my favorite part of the job was learning new problem
          solving technologies. When it became clear I was ready for a
          career change, software development stood out as the ultimate
          problem solving technology. I started teaching myself web
          development and was immediately hooked. I found my way into a boot
          camp and which pushed my capacity for learning even farther. The
          more I learn the more it solidifies that Software Development is
          exactly where I want to be.
