Delete cards for artists from favorites.
Problem solved:
There are over 400 unique artists who have made works for the game.
Ever wonder who made that card you love so much or found so striking? This tool will let the user find cards based on search criteria they are interested in (name, type, sub-type). Then the user can explore all the art that Artist has made by clicking a button.
